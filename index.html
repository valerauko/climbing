  text: Elbrus was my first of the Seven Summits. It was the first time I went above 4000m altitude and it taught me not to take such endeavors lightly. Would go back someday for a ski trip for sure.

    date: February 2020

  text: The highest mountain outside of the Himalayas, I prepared seriously for Aconcagua. Still at base camp my body decided it can't handle it and I had really bad altitude sickness for a few days. Luckily then it got better and I could reach the summit in perfect weather.
